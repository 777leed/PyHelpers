# PyHelpers
more python scripts to facilitate more tasks.
I made a script to take terms/words/senteces from an md file and turns them into a list, translates them and put them on a google sheet using pygsheets package and deep_translator
this script is particularly made for me to put my spanish vocabulary in a google sheet with the translation so I can later export it into anki which is a spaced repetition program
