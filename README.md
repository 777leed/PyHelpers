# PyHelpers
more python scripts to facilitate more tasks.
## gsHelper :
I made a script to take terms/words/senteces from an md file and turns them into a list, translates them and put them on a google sheet using pygsheets package and deep_translator
this script is particularly made for me to put my spanish vocabulary in a google sheet with the translation so I can later export it into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which is a spaced repetition program
## lwtHelper :
I made a script that takes in a YouTube URL and writes a file with the transcription of the video, the videos should have Spanish subtitles though (Change the script to your target language if desired) because the purpose of the script for me is to never run out of text for [LWT](https://learning-with-texts.sourceforge.io/) which is as it says a language learning software, check it out It's really intresting.
